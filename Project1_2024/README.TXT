PROJECT TITLE: CS 150 Project 1
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To simulate a river ecosystem
VERSION or DATE: 2/11/2024
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Please unzip the Project 1 folder, and click on the package.bluej. The project can be run 
through the the bluej interface. The main method is contained within the RiverSimulator class.
AUTHORS: Padmanabh Kaushik
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Please keep all fines in the Project 1 folder intact while running the code.

Notes:

Problems encountered while implementing the project:
I ran into issues using inheritence structures and implementing abstract classes. I had to spend a lot of looking
at Java inheritence examples to get a better of the concept. Additionally, I made syntax errors while defining the
absracr classes, which resulted in compiling errors. Looking at appropriate java documentation helped me resolve this
issue. 

Functionalities not successfully implemente:
I couldn't implement unit test methods that could test the cases where random moves were made, or random animals were 
generated. Although there was a set protcol of how this random behavior was to be generated, I couldn't find out a way 
to test it using assertEquals or assertTrue, because I didn't know what the random number generator will generate. As such
I couldn't hand calculate the probable outcomes for certain inputs. As such, I'm not very sure about if some of these 
methods are working well in all cases.

Lessons learnt:
While implementing this lab, I learned to work with major inheritence structures in java, creting and working with abstract
classes, creating custom classes, and working with scanners.
