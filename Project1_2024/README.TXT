Notes:

Problems encountered while implementing the project:
I ran into issues using inheritance structures and implementing abstract classes. I had to spend a lot of time looking
at Java inheritance examples to get a better idea of the concept. Additionally, I made syntax errors while defining the
abstract classes, which resulted in compiling errors. Looking at appropriate Java documentation helped me resolve this
issue.
